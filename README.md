# Refer EDA.ipynb for approaching any data science problem :
1. Reading data using pandas and deciding the feature set.
2. Remove missing values and outliers
2. Analyze correlation of dependent variables with independent variables
3. Remove multicollinarity if any to reduce dimensions and prevent independent variables from influencing one another.
4. Plot trends chart for denpendent variable
5. Run the algorithm of your choice from Scikit-learn. The code mentioned here uses Random forest and Light GBM for sales prediction
